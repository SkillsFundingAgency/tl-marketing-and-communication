                <p>Employers have told us that you face a skills shortage that could impact the future success of your businesses. In response, the government has worked alongside more than 220 employers to design T Level courses that deliver the skills your organisations need. </p>
                <p>These employers span a range of industries, and include household names, such as Fujitsu, Skanska and GlaxoSmithKline, as well as many smaller employers.</p>

                <p>Employers tell us that the current range of vocational education courses is confusing and doesn’t always meet your needs. </p>
                <p>T Levels are part of the government’s plan to simplify vocational education and create a system that you can trust and understand. They provide a clear and high-quality, technical alternative to the current range of post-16 education and training options.</p>

                <p>Industry placements give you a unique opportunity to help develop new talent and get young people work ready. They also bring many <a href="/employers/business-benefits" id="tl-employer-about-businessbenefits" class="tl-link-inline-black--purple">business benefits</a>.</p>
