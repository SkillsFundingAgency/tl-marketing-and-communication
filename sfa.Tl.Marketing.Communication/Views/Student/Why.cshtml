                <h2>Created with business</h2>
                <p>T Levels have been designed with leading businesses and employers to give you the knowledge and skills you need.</p>
                <p>More than 200 businesses – including Fujitsu and Skanska – have been involved so you can be confident your T Level will move you to the next level.</p>

                <h2>Get ahead in your career</h2>
                <p>T Levels give you the chance to learn what a real career is like while you continue your studies.</p>
                <p>
                    Your industry placement will last for at least 45 days – when and how you complete it depends on the T Level, college and employer. Check out <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J4hdOsUbYF0" class="tl-link-inline-black--orange">student views on industry placements</a>.

                <p>When you pass your T Level, you will get a nationally recognised certificate showing the overall grade you achieved - pass, merit, distinction or distinction*. It will also give details of what you learned on the course to help you move into skilled employment or a higher apprenticeship.</p>

                <p>Your T Level will be worth UCAS points – a T Level Distinction* is worth the same as 3 A Levels at A* – and will be recognised by universities and other education providers so you can choose to continue studying if you wish.</p>

                <h2>Learn your way</h2>
                <p>T Levels involve more classroom study than apprenticeships, which means you can experience an industry while you continue your studies.</p>
                <p>Like A Levels, there are no tuition fees to study a T Level if you start before you are 19. Schools and colleges set their own entry requirements, so check their website or contact them direct to find out more.</p>
