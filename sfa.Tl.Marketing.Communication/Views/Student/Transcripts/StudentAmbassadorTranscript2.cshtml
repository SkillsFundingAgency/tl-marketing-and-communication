                    I chose to do this T Level because it’s the course that could offer me the most opportunities and experiences, hopefully guiding me into what I want to do when I’m older.

                </p>
                <p>For example, this is working in an early years setting so it could be like a room leader or early years practitioner.</p>
                <p>I would definitely recommend this course to anyone who is considering this pathway. The unique T Levels really give students an opportunity to study in the classroom and apply the skills and knowledge that they have learnt outside of a school and classroom environment.</p>
